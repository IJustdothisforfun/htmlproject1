            <p>i attend a target shooting club most weeks and have began to shoot competitively winning my first competition in march last year. i have also played video games for
                the majority of my life, the first game i brought with my own money was minecraft back in 2011 and one of the first games i played was mario kart wii. 
                the game i have gotten into most recently has been DCS world (it is proving to be rather pricey). i have also spent a few years messing around in various languages so know a few bits in multiple programming languages.
